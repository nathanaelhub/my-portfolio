## Overview

This data mining project compares different clustering algorithms to analyze COVID-19 transmission patterns. By applying spectral clustering, K-means, and KNN clustering techniques, the analysis identifies relationships between peaks in transmission across different regions.

## Key Objectives

- **Algorithm Comparison**: Evaluate performance of different clustering methods
- **Pattern Discovery**: Identify clusters of similar transmission patterns
- **Peak Analysis**: Understand the timing and relationships between transmission peaks
- **Methodology Insights**: Determine which clustering approach works best for epidemiological data

## Methodology

- **Data Collection**: COVID-19 case data from multiple regions over time
- **Preprocessing**: Time series normalization and feature extraction
- **Clustering Algorithms**: Implementation of K-means, KNN, and Spectral Clustering
- **Evaluation**: Silhouette scores and cluster quality metrics

## Clustering Approaches

1. **K-means Clustering**: Traditional centroid-based clustering for pattern grouping
2. **KNN Clustering**: Density-based approach using nearest neighbor relationships
3. **Spectral Clustering**: Graph-based method capturing complex cluster structures

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **Scikit-learn**: Clustering algorithm implementations
- **NumPy & Pandas**: Data manipulation
- **Visualization**: Cluster visualization and comparison charts

## Key Findings

Spectral clustering proved most effective at capturing non-linear relationships between transmission patterns, revealing geographic and temporal clusters that traditional methods missed.
