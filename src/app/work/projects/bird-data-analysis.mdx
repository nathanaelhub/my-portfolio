## Overview

This project performs exploratory data analysis on bird observation data, uncovering patterns in species distribution, migration, and population trends. The analysis combines statistical methods with visualization to reveal insights about avian ecology.

## Key Objectives

- **Species Analysis**: Examine distribution patterns of different bird species
- **Temporal Patterns**: Identify seasonal and migration-related trends
- **Geographic Distribution**: Map bird observations across different regions
- **Population Insights**: Track population changes over time

## Methodology

- **Data Exploration**: Initial analysis to understand data structure and quality
- **Statistical Analysis**: Correlation analysis and trend identification
- **Visualization**: Geographic mapping and time series visualization
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identification of significant ecological patterns

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core analysis and programming
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and aggregation
- **Visualization Libraries**: Matplotlib, Seaborn for charts and graphs
- **Geospatial Tools**: Mapping bird observation locations

## Key Findings

The analysis revealed interesting patterns in species distribution and seasonal movement, contributing to ecological understanding and conservation efforts.
