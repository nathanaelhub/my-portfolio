## Overview

Developed a comprehensive portfolio optimization platform that implements multiple investment strategies and provides real-time analytics for investment decision-making. The system combines advanced financial modeling with intuitive user interfaces.

## Investment Strategies

- **Modern Portfolio Theory (Markowitz)**: Classic mean-variance optimization for efficient frontier construction
- **Black-Litterman Model**: Bayesian approach incorporating investor views and market equilibrium
- **Risk Parity**: Equal risk contribution allocation across portfolio components
- **Custom Strategies**: Flexible framework for implementing additional optimization approaches

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Data Integration**: Live market data feeds for accurate portfolio valuation
- **Interactive Analytics**: Dynamic dashboards with drill-down capabilities and customizable views
- **Risk Analysis**: Comprehensive risk metrics including VaR, CVaR, and stress testing
- **Backtesting Engine**: Historical performance analysis and strategy validation
- **Multi-Asset Support**: Stocks, bonds, commodities, and alternative investments

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Backend development with Flask/Django framework
- **Financial Libraries**: NumPy, SciPy, PyPortfolioOpt for mathematical optimization
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for storing historical data and portfolio configurations
- **Frontend**: React.js with D3.js for interactive data visualization
- **APIs**: Integration with financial data providers (Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance)
- **Cloud Deployment**: AWS/Azure for scalable hosting and data processing

## Architecture

1. **Data Layer**: Real-time market data ingestion and historical data management
2. **Optimization Engine**: Core algorithms for portfolio optimization and risk calculation
3. **API Layer**: RESTful APIs for frontend communication and external integrations
4. **Frontend Dashboard**: Responsive web application with real-time updates
5. **Analytics Module**: Advanced reporting and performance attribution analysis

## Results

The platform successfully provides sophisticated portfolio optimization capabilities typically found in institutional investment management systems, making advanced portfolio theory accessible through an intuitive interface.

## Business Applications

This system demonstrates practical applications of quantitative finance and showcases the integration of complex mathematical models with modern web technologies to create powerful financial tools.
