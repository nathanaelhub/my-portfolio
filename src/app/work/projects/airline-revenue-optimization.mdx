## Overview

Developed a sophisticated machine learning system to predict airline passenger no-shows and optimize overbooking strategies, resulting in significant revenue improvements while minimizing passenger displacement.

## Key Features

- **Predictive Modeling**: Built advanced ML models to predict passenger no-show probability based on historical data, booking patterns, and passenger characteristics
- **Cost-Sensitive Learning**: Implemented cost-sensitive algorithms that account for the varying costs of overbooking scenarios
- **Monte Carlo Simulations**: Used simulation techniques to model different overbooking scenarios and their financial outcomes
- **Revenue Optimization**: Developed optimization algorithms to maximize revenue while maintaining customer satisfaction

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core development language for all modeling and analysis
- **Scikit-learn & XGBoost**: For building and tuning predictive models
- **NumPy & Pandas**: For data manipulation and statistical analysis
- **Monte Carlo Methods**: For risk assessment and scenario modeling
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization and results presentation

## Methodology

1. **Data Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of historical booking and no-show patterns
2. **Feature Engineering**: Created predictive features from booking data, passenger history, and external factors
3. **Model Development**: Built and compared multiple ML algorithms including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks
4. **Cost Integration**: Incorporated business costs of overbooking vs. empty seats into model optimization
5. **Simulation Testing**: Validated strategies using Monte Carlo simulations on historical data

## Results

The system achieved significant improvements in revenue optimization while maintaining operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. The predictive models demonstrated high accuracy in no-show prediction, enabling more confident overbooking decisions.

## Business Impact

This project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in revenue management, showcasing how data science can directly contribute to business profitability while balancing operational constraints.
