## Overview

This project focuses on predicting car sale prices using machine learning techniques. Through comprehensive data cleaning, feature engineering, and regression modeling, the analysis provides accurate price predictions based on vehicle characteristics.

## Key Objectives

- **Price Prediction**: Develop accurate models to predict car sale prices
- **Feature Analysis**: Identify the most influential factors affecting car prices
- **Data Quality**: Implement robust data cleaning and preprocessing pipelines
- **Model Comparison**: Evaluate multiple regression algorithms for optimal performance

## Methodology

- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new features from existing data to improve model performance
- **Model Selection**: Tested multiple regression algorithms including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting
- **Validation**: Used cross-validation to ensure model robustness

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical computing
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning model development
- **Visualization**: Data visualization for insights and model interpretation

## Results

The final model achieved strong predictive accuracy, identifying vehicle age, mileage, brand, and condition as the primary price determinants.
