## Scenario

In data analysis, ethical dilemmas arise when the pressure to achieve desired results conflicts with the integrity of the analysis. Consider a scenario where a supervisor suggests removing specific data points because initial results don't align with expectations.

While removing the points may produce more favorable outcomes, doing so raises serious ethical questions.

## Steps for Ethical Decision-Making

### 1. Review the Data

Examine the dataset to understand the nature and significance of the points in question. Determine whether they are outliers, errors, or valid observations that could substantially impact the analysis.

### 2. Assess Data Quality

Conduct statistical analyses to evaluate how excluding these points affects overall results. Comparing analyses with and without the points helps clarify their impact.

### 3. Context Matters

Consider domain-specific factors that might justify excluding or keeping the points. A deep dive into the subject matter ensures well-informed decisions.

### 4. Seek Diverse Perspectives

Discuss the situation with peers or experts to gather diverse insights and avoid blind spots.

### 5. Document Everything

Keep detailed records of your process, rationale, and conclusions. Documentation ensures transparency and accountability.

## Communicating Different Results

If your assessment leads to a different conclusion than your supervisor expected, present your findings openly and respectfully:

- Highlight risks or biases associated with excluding data
- Propose alternatives (such as sensitivity analyses)
- Foster open dialogue emphasizing data integrity

## Balancing Objectives and Ethics

Ethical decision-making in data analysis means balancing objectives with integrity. Advocating for data quality while engaging in collaborative discussion preserves the credibility and reliability of analysis and builds trust.
